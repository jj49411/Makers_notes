## Weekly Goals

1. Build a simple web app
2. Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
3. Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
4. Explain the MVC pattern
 

## Daily Goals
### Day 1
- GOAL: Learn web basics- request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS. Review others' code
- REFLECTION: Grabbed the ideas of request/response which was fun! 
> We went through steps of basic HTTP and built a Sinatra application as a server
```
Feedback on my weekend challenge: 
1) "testing the behaviour rather than the state"
2) use `puts` for normal output
3) better to have a method on the Menu class that allows you to get the dish rather than exposing the menu attribute and allowing people to change the menu whenever they like.
4) `allow(menu).to receive(:menu).and_return({ "sausage" => 4 }) ` so it can call the menu on the double menu
```

### Day 2
- GOAL: Work on practical-1, drafting the blog post
- REFLECTION: Had better understanding on the HTTP request/response and how to apply the HTTP cycle
