# Week 2

[Weekly Goals](#weekly-goals) | [Daily Goals](#daily-goals) | [Weekly Challenge](#weekly-challenge) | [Weekend Challenge](#weekend-challenge) | [Workshops](#workshops)



## Weekly Goals

1. Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
2. Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
3. Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
4. Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
5. Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback


## Daily Goals
### Day 1
- GOAL: Review other's weekend challenge and improve my knowledge on `let-double` method #(Read through Code review rubric)
- REFLECTION: Reviewed other's code following the rubuic. Understood the basics of Gemfile/gems/bundle/rvm and found out "refactoring" is my main problem when using TDD process. 
> Got a sense of how to review others' codes but still neeed more practice! 
> During the pairing we switched the driver-navigator role frequently and answered all the "interview questions". 

### Day 2
- GOAL: Underdstand Ruby class constants
- REFLECTION: Knowing the use of `constants` `!!` and `::` `let double` `before` in RSpec . Learning the feedback skills though the workshop which I found helpful. 
> Today's painging was a seccess! I felt that my techinical/debugging/refactoring skills are better than yesterday. I was surprised how many knowledge gaps were actually covered in the exercise.
> We shared ideas and communicated well as my pair is good at explaining things and using IRB as examples!


### Day 3
- GOAL: Practise turing user stories to Domain model, and turn Domain model to the code
- REFLECTION: A bit struggled when turning the idea (Domain model) to the code, practiced on the programme "flip-coins". Worked on the practical "Secretdiary" to build the test of the code
> 
Secretdiary
Domain model: flip_coins/notebook

### Day 4
- GOAL: Go through some practicals to understand the relationships between classes/the logic of RSPec
- REFLECTION: Through the practical practice "SecretDiary" I used `double` `expect to receive`
"Building Rspec" through the excerices I built up the code to see what 


finish practical 1- SecretDiary, understand `double` `expect to receive`
finish practical 2- Building Rspec

### Day 5
- GOAL: (talk to Sophie about flip-coins)
- REFLECTION: 
>
Look at 5 solids, make examples on each of them
Dependency Injection
Polymorphism
Forwarding

## Weekly Challenge
- **Oystercard**:
Repo [here](https://github.com/jj49411/oystercard)

- **Middle-Characters**:
The programme returns the middle character of a word. Using TDD approach and screen-recording to examine my programming process. Built the code in 30 mins following the cycle RED - GREEN - REFACTORING. Needed to improve in refactoring. Repo [here](https://github.com/jj49411/middle_characters)
*find out the solution for #middle_charcs

- **Secret-Diary**:
One of our practicals to test the relationships between classes. By creating a test after the code has been written.

## Workshops

### Peer Code Review

|Code reviewing | Details|
|-------------- | ------|
|Why do we review code? | - Improve the code<br>- Learn solving problems|
|Why peer revirw? | - Communication skills<br>- Pair programming<br>- Learn from each other|
|Why adding README? |- Clear instruction<br>- How to iteract with the repo


### Process Workshop

1. We paired up and each of us took turns to spent 30 mins on writing a programme using TDD process. One of us recorded our screen and drive-test the excercise, at the same time, the other person observed it and gave feedback aftterwards. 

2. Purpose: Impove the approach to programming. To see where you get stuck, how you debug and how good is your TDD approach to TDD process.

3. I practiced on a small programme [Middle-Characters](https://github.com/jj49411/middle_characters) following the cycle RED - GREEN - REFACTORING. I found the regactoring part a bit tough as I kept putting the easiest codes to pass the test (make it GREEN) without refactoring it efficiently. 

### Feedback Workshop

1. Why is Feedback so difficult?
- Love&Acceptance vs Learning&Growth

2. How can we make feedback easier?
- Shift your perspective. Not positive nor nagetive, see it as nutural "Feedback is kind!"
- Empowered receiver. #freetherapy
- Know thyself. 
**Feedback triggers**: Truth triggers/Relationship triggers/Idantity triggers
- Understand feedback
- Use a framework

3. Expression
- When I see/hear...
- I feel...
- Beacause I need...
- Would you be willing...

### Domain Modelling

Useful tool: draw.io


EXTRA
https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/adventures/learning_by_building_rspec.md
Practical---Learning by building rspec
includes 4 excercises (with pic)
-> to understand the logic of rspec, what does a test actually expect
-> not using rspec to test, instead, creating a rspec
