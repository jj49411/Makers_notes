# Week 2

[Weekly Goals](#weekly-goals) | [Daily Goals](#daily-goals) | [Weekly Challenge](#weekly-challenge) | [Weekend Challenge](#weekend-challenge) | [Workshops](#workshops)



## Weekly Goals

1. Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
2. Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
3. Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
4. Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
5. Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback


## Daily Goals
### Day 1
- GOAL: Review another persons' weekend challenge/Improve my knowledge on let-double method/Read through Code review rubric
- REFLECTION: 
> Still not quite sure how to review anthers' codes

#Day 1 :
-Review on the weekend challenge
Add README
let-double
double:
As an object
first time you call it: run the call, create double
second time you call it: return the double

*add process workshop reflection 
*finish the post for week1 / notes
*let-double
*find out the solution for #middle_charcs

## Workshops

### Kick off 

1. Why do we review code?
- Improve the code 
- Learn solving problems

2. Why peer revirw?
- Communication skills
- Pair programming
- Learn from each other

3. README
- Clear instruction
- How to iteract with the repo

 
### Process Workshop

1. We paired up and each of us took turns to spent 30 mins on writing a programme using TDD process. One of us recorded our screen and drive-test the excercise, at the same time, the other person observed it and gave feedback aftterwards. 

2. Purpose: Impove the approach to programming. To see where you get stuck, how you debug and how good is your TDD approach to TDD process.

3. I practiced on a small programme [middle-characters](middle-characters) following the cycle RED - GREEN - REFACTORING. I found the regactoring part a bit tough as I kept putting the easiest codes to pass the test (make it GREEN) without refactoring it efficiently. 

### Review Workshop
