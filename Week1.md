# Week 1

## Weekly Goals

1. Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
2. Pair using the driver-navigator style
3. Follow an effective debugging process
4. Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

### Daily Goals
#### Day 1
- GOAL: Debug errors using the knowledge from the workshop
- REFLECTION: Learned the pairing/debugging skills
> We did it well on our first pairing programming of the project, working on diagrams which outlined the structure of the project and brainstorming the ideas

#### Day 2
- GOAL: Understand some basic ideas of TDD/ Improve my knowledge of Domain Modelling, Feature Test and User Stories
- REFLECTION: Got lots of practice in reading error messages, debugging
> We folloewd the steps, stopped and explained to each other the error messages, swiched deiver/navigator frequently
> Figured out the gaps during the pairing

#### Day 3
- GOAL: basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP & Debugging
- REFLECTION:

#### Day 4
- GOAL: Practice TTD throght Birthdays project. Filling all the knowledge gaps
- REFLECTION:
