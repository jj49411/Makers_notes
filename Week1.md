2. Pair using the driver-navigator style
3. Follow an effective debugging process
4. Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

### Daily Goals
#### Day 1
- GOAL: Debug errors using the knowledge from the workshop/
- REFLECTION: -about pairing/debug
>> We did it well on our first pairing programming of the project, working on diagrams which outlined the structure of the project, brainstormed the ideas

#### Day 2
- GOAL: Understand some basic ideas of TDD/ Improve my knowledge of Domain Modelling, Feature Test and User Stories
- REFLECTION:
>> We folloewd the steps, stopped and explained to each other the error messages, swiched deiver/navigator frequently
>> walk throgh the gaps during the pairing. 

#### Day 3
