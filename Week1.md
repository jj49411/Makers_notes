# Week 1

[Weekly Goals](#weekly-goals) | [Daily Goals](#daily-goals) | [Weekly Challenge](#weekly-challenge) | [Weekend Challenge](#weekend-challenge) | [Workshops](#workshops)



## Weekly Goals

1. Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
2. Pair using the driver-navigator style
3. Follow an effective debugging process
4. Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

## Daily Goals
### Day 1
- GOAL: Debug errors using the knowledge from the workshop
- REFLECTION: Learned the pairing/debugging skills
> We did it well on our first pairing programming of the project, working on diagrams which outlined the structure of the project and brainstorming the ideas

### Day 2
- GOAL: Understand some basic ideas of TDD (Test Driven Development)/ Improve my knowledge of Domain Modelling, Feature Test and User Stories
- REFLECTION: Got lots of practice in reading error messages, debugging, RSpect
> We folloewd the steps, stopped and explained to each other the error messages, swiched deiver/navigator frequently
> Figured out the gaps during the pairing

### Day 3
- GOAL: Look at basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP & Debugging and some Ruby methods `map` `initialize`
- REFLECTION: Got better understanding on TDD process and OO principles through the workshop
> In the afternoon pairing, we went backwards a few steps to make sure we match our understanding from the workshop with the current project. It was great practice as we explained to each other the purpose of each steps. 

### Day 4
- GOAL: Practice TDD throght Birthdays project. Understand `attr_asscessor` `DEFAULT_VALUE` and fill in knowledge gaps
- REFLECTION: Better degugging skills (find out solutions from error messages). Built up my solo project Birthdays.
> I learned how to improve README and spec-rb files structure from my pair. Looked into private methods


## Weekly Challenge
- **Boris-Bikes**:
Created the Domain model based on the user stories. Operating feature tests and unit tests to code step by step. Completed as part of a pair. Repo [here](https://github.com/jj49411/boris_bikes)

- **Birthdays**:
A programme to store friends' birthdays and check whose birthday is it today. Using TDD process and OO principles. Repo [here](https://github.com/jj49411/birthdays)

## Weekend Challenge
- **Airport**:
Wrote a programme from a request of a client to control the flow of planes at an airport, considering the weather change and default capacity. Using TDD approach to test drive a set of classes/modules. Repo [here](https://github.com/jj49411/airport_challenge)


## Workshops

### Debugging Workshop

1. How will you validate that you progress towards the week 1 goals?
 -	Feedbacks from peers â€“ reflection
 -	Working code 
 -	Airport challenge
 -	Screen recording
 -	Diagram of process
 -	Explain to someone
 -	Write an explaination

2. Bugs
-	Programme is not working as intended â€“Syntax error/ Runtime error (name error)/ Programme not terminating/ Unexpected results

3. Debugging
-	Understand the problem
-	Fix it (intentional)
-	Look, click on slaktries

### TDD Workshop

1. TDD
- Process of writing a test to guide the codes that meets user needs
- Reason of using it is to help to break down the problem, build the project step by step
- Can serve as docs/ Acts as safety net

2. Steps of building up a project
- Define user needs
- Write user stories
- Domain Model
- Write a feature test (What is the beheviour I expect?)
- `rspec -fd` (gives a description of the actions the code do)

3. Things we need to use in spec file
- `expect` matchers
    - `.to eq`
    - `.to raise_error`
    - `.to output`
- `describe`
- `it`

4. Live Coding
**PiggyBank**
- Store money
- Discourge people from taking it out
- Destroy/take the money out
- Shaking it to check there is money inside
- PiggyBank object/ store method
- User Story: 
```
As a user. 
So I can save up money. 
I want to store money in a piggy bank.
```

**Feature Test**
```
piggy_bank = PiggyBank.new
piggy_bank.store(1)
=> "clink"
```
```
piggy_bank = PiggyBank.new
piggy_bank.store(1)
piggy_bank.destory
=> 1
```

**Spec File**
```
describe PiggyBank do
  descibe "#store" do
    it "should return 'clink' when I store 1 pound" do
    piggy_bank = PiggyBank.new
    expect(piggy_bank.store(1)).to eq ('clink')
  end
end
```
```
decribe "#destory" do
  it "should return 1 when I ha stored 1 pound" do
    #arrange
    piggy_bank = PiggyBank.new
    piggy_bank.store(1)
    #act + assert
    expect(piggy_bank.detrory).to eq (1)
  end
end
```


**Rb File**
```
class PiggyBank
  def store(amount)
    "clink" if amount > 0
  end
  
  def detory
  end
end
```
