## Weekly Goals

1. Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript
2. Follow an effective process for learning a new language
 

## Daily Goals
### Day 1
- GOAL: Review other's code and get the basics of Javascript
- REFLECTION: Great to see how others organised their web app and files. Learned some basic syntax and ideas of JS, would need more practice! 
> Learnign a new language can be confusing, but it was fun!
```
Peer code review:
- "SELECT content, date FROM peeps ORDER BY date DESC;" to sort out the order of the peeps
- Adding a test database to test the functionality
```

### Day 2
- GOAL: Practice on Javascript and Jasmine(testing framework) get used to the syntax `function` `{}` `jasmineSpyObj`
- REFLECTION: Rewrited the Fizzbuzz challenge in the morning. Tried to rewrite Airport challenge in Javascript and started on the weekly challenge Thermostat
> It was great practice to rewrite the projects we've done before in Ruby and got my head around with Javascript syntax. Nice pairing with my partner, we swapped the driver/navigator roles regularly and tried our best to immerse in JS!


### Day 3
- GOAL: Test-drive the business logic of Thermostat project using Javascript. Understand the behaviour of the keyword `this`
- REFLECTION: Created the model step by step based on the specifications. Strictly followed the TDD process
> We managed to build the logic, translated the specifications into tests and made them pass. Later on spent much time restucture and refactor our code, using constants instead of magic numbers

### Day 4
- GOAL: Using HTML/CSS to create a user interface on the web. Understand JQuery and learn how to get visibility in Javascript (in the workshop) `console.log()` `debugger`
- REFLECTION: Decided what HTML elements we need to serve as controls on the thermostat and to display the thermostat data, labelling them with IDs on the HTML page. Using JQuery `$(document).ready()` to link the logic with the interface and building interactive functionality into a webpage 
> When buliding up the user interface and deciding which elements to put, we realised that we missed some of the functions so we went back to modify our model, finally linked the functionality and make the webpage work

### Day 5
- GOAL: Use AJAX to retrieve data from an API and style the thermostat, play around CSS!
- REFLECTION: Implement weather API for Thermostat project and use `<div>`, CSS to make my thermostat look better  
> Thanks to my partner who guided me to learn CSS much quicker!

## Weekly reflection

It was a lot going on this week as usual, I was excited about learning Javascript and found out that it was indeed easier to learn the second language than the first time learning Ruby! Will spend more time practicing JS during the coming break.
