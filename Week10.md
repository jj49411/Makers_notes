### Kickoff of the week

1. What are they looking for during the interviews?
- Not looking for professional
- Proactive receptive to feedback
- Potential 
- Pair skills

2. Fruit Machine
- User stories/diagrams - classes, functions, features
- Process flow
```
start game
debit 10 from from player (enough money?)(pull level)
show colours
win?
-yes play
-no end game
```
1-- Break problem down into features? (edge cases)

```
Features
Scenario: player starts a game
when a player starts a game
Then the player waits for the colour bar

Scenario: player starts a game
When a player starts a game
Then the player pay 10 quid

Scenario: when the player wins
When the player wins the game
Then she sees the message "You win!"

Scenario: when the player loses
When the player loses the game
Then she sees the message "You lose"

```
2-- Domain modelling

```
nouns+verbs
class diagrams
from the user perspective
```

- Units:

```
player
fruit machine
slots
random colour
jackpor
```

3-- Experiment/research

4-- Plan 

```
user stories- what's the order
start with the simpliest
edge cases the last
```

5-- Setup project

```
test framework
linter
readme (include the previous planning)
test coverage
git
```

6-- Start from a feature test


### Tech interview

1. What to expect
- take home test
- pair programme 
keep talking
- past projects
final + 1
ducument the challenge
- chit chat

why you choose that tech?
